 * Construct Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List Representation
 * Given Linked List Representation of Complete Binary Tree, construct the Binary tree. A complete binary tree can be
 * represented in an array in the following approach.

 If root node is stored at index i, its left, and right children are stored at indices 2*i+1, 2*i+2 respectively.
 Suppose tree is represented by a linked list in same way, how do we convert this into normal linked representation of
 binary tree where every node has data, left and right pointers? In the linked list representation, we cannot
 directly access the children of the current node unless we traverse the list.
